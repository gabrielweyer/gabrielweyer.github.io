<article class="post-content">
  <p>I like football, even with the time difference I try to watch at least the World Cup and the European Championship. I watched the last World Cup on <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/">SBS</a> but this time around they only managed to secure a handful of games. As they’re a public service it makes sense after all that they wouldn’t buy the rights for all the games. A quick search on Google indicated that <a href="http://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/home">beIN SPORTS CONNECT</a> is the way to go in Australia - I will refer to this service as beIN for the rest of this post.</p>

<h1 id="subscribing">Subscribing</h1>

<p>As the pricing seems reasonable I decided to go ahead. The page is loaded over HTTPS so we start well but to my surprise the form contains a <strong>password remainder</strong> field. Password remainders are a bad practice as users tend to fill them with their password (when allowed) or with a hint that is an obvious give away.<!--more--></p>

<p>As I don’t know any of my password, a password reminder is useless to me so I always generate a strong unique random password for this field. After trying to submit the form I got the following error:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2016-06-13-bein-sports-connect/password-remainder.png" alt="password-remainder" /></p>

<p>I don’t understand the benefits of restricting the characters I can use. On the contrary it seems to indicate this site is potentially vulnerable to <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/understanding-xss-input-sanitisation/">XSS</a>. I generate another reminder without “special” characters and get presented with another error:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2016-06-13-bein-sports-connect/invalid-format.png" alt="invalid-format" /></p>

<p>So my valid email address is in an “Incorrect format”. How convenient should they ever decide to sell my data to a third party without me being able to track it back to them.</p>

<p>I start to have a bad feeling about the password requirements. After all the only one that is stated is that my password should be at least 6 characters. I decide to use “123456” and also use it as the password reminder. <strong>&lt;clickbait&gt;</strong>You won’t believe what happens next!<strong>&lt;/clickbait&gt;</strong>. Actually I’m sure you knew what would happen: the form happily accepted my password and let me reuse it in the reminder field. Well at least I “<em>can access the site</em> <strong>securely</strong>” (emphasis is mine).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2016-06-13-bein-sports-connect/123456.png" alt="123456" /></p>

<p>One last thing before we move on to the dessert. Does it seem normal to be loading so many third party JavaScript files on a registration page? They’re even loading ads and we know what malicious ads do to your browser and it’s not kind (malware installation, credentials theft…).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2016-06-13-bein-sports-connect/do-you-need-ads-on-signup.png" alt="do-you-need-ads-on-signup.png" /></p>

<h1 id="sign-inform-loaded-over-http">Sign-in form loaded over HTTP</h1>

<p>Yes you read that right. Even though the form is POSTing to HTTPS by then it is <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/your-login-form-posts-to-https-but-you/">too late</a>. An attacker could have already intercepted the initial HTTP response and pointed the form to the URL of his choosing.</p>

<p>Sometimes websites still offer sign-in over HTTPS when you look for it but it doesn’t seem to be the case here.  <a href="https://secure.beinsportsconnect.com.au/">https://secure.beinsportsconnect.com.au/</a> redirects to <a href="http://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/">http://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/</a> and trying to access <a href="https://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/">https://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/</a> results in something you should never see:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2016-06-13-bein-sports-connect/bein-loaded-over-https.png" alt="bein-loaded-over-https.png" /></p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>If you’re already using beIN or are planning on starting to use it at least generate a unique password so that when they get compromised attackers will not gain access to your account on other services.</p>

<p>I understand going all HTTPS would require a tremendous amount of work but beIN could first take some other steps that would make a big difference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the password reminder altogether</li>
  <li>Provide a dedicated HTTPS only sign-in page</li>
  <li>Stop loading third-party ads on the sign-in page</li>
</ul>

            <p>I like football, even with the time difference I try to watch at least the World Cup and the European Championship. I watched the last World Cup on <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/">SBS</a> but this time around they only managed to secure a handful of games. As they’re a public service it makes sense after all that they wouldn’t buy the rights for all the games. A quick search on Google indicated that <a href="http://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/home">beIN SPORTS CONNECT</a> is the way to go in Australia - I will refer to this service as beIN for the rest of this post.</p>

<h1 id="subscribing">Subscribing</h1>

<p>As the pricing seems reasonable I decided to go ahead. The page is loaded over HTTPS so we start well but to my surprise the form contains a <strong>password remainder</strong> field. Password remainders are a bad practice as users tend to fill them with their password (when allowed) or with a hint that is an obvious give away.</p>

            <p>Recently I came up with an interesting issue at a customer. A governmental agency contacted us and informed us that due to a Windows update we could experience intermittent issue when trying to communicate with them. All I knew at this stage was that the issue would manifest itself when trying to upload a document and that the integration is done via DLLs that are wrapping a few web services.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/decompiler/2016.1/Generating_PDB_Files.html">generating PDBs</a> via <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/">dotPeek</a> and adding them to the Visual Studio symbol cache directory I was able to debug through those third party DLLs and confirm that the issue was indeed located in one of them.</p>

<p>Knowing the DLL is redistributed with the product, is in multiple production versions and that the source control’s history is pretty patchy, the question then become: <strong>if we were to get a new DLL could we use it for all the versions?</strong></p>

<p>To answer this question we will have to assess the differences between the DLL in each version.</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            <p>Being the happy owner of a Kindle I usually buy my ebooks on Amazon. They have a very large selection to choose from and normally sell all the latest releases. To my surprise they only had “<a href="(http://us.macmillan.com/enigmaofchina/qiuxiaolong)">Enigma of China</a>” from Qiu Xialong in paperback and hardcover formats. <a href="http://store.kobobooks.com/en-US/Search/Query?query=Enigma%20of%20China&amp;dontModifyQuery=True">Kobo</a> didn’t have it at all but after searching for a while I found out that Barnes &amp; Noble sold it as a <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/enigma-of-china-qiu-xiaolong/1114701902?ean=9781250025814">NOOK Book</a> for $10.</p>

<p>So far, so good or so it seemed. It turned out that Barnes &amp; Noble has such a lax approach of security that at the end I decided not to purchase from them. You’ll find below the reasons that motivated my decision.</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            <p>Internet has taken a preponderant place in our lives and most of us regularly purchase goods on Internet or use Internet banking. The access to the services we use is protected by a password and humans are not good at managing passwords:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most of us will reuse the same password on many services (combine this with the fact that people also use the same email address to log in into said services and you get an explosive mix when security is breached on one <a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/gawker-hack-acai-spam-twitter/">service</a>).</li>
  <li>Most of us will use weak passwords, basically as weak as the service will allow. Not only our passwords are weak they’re also extremely <a href="https://www.duosecurity.com/blog/brief-analysis-of-the-gawker-password-dump">predictable</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To address those issues you need to use <strong>strong unique</strong> passwords. By <strong>strong</strong> I mean that your passwords should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>long (let’s say at least 25 characters)</li>
  <li>a mix of lower / upper case letters, digits and symbols</li>
  <li>randomly generated (by a random generator not by you typing random keys on your keyboard)</li>
</ul>

<p>By <strong>unique</strong> I mean that you should <em>never</em> reuse a password. You should set a different password on each service. As we tend to use many services and tend to log in from multiple devices (home and work computers, smartphones, tablets..) it makes it impossible to remember all those strong passwords.</p>

<p>Google has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RCsHJfHL_4">recommended</a> the use of sentence and substitution, something even stronger has been advocated by <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">xkcd</a>. But this doesn’t work. I use over a hundred different services, how could I remember a hundred different sentences? Common substitutions (the one you will use) are also well documented and will be attempted by the attackers to guess your password. Other experts have advised to <a href="https://medium.com/cyber-security/9ed56d483eb">get rid of passwords</a> altogether, but this opinion is unconventional to say the least.</p>

<p>Want it or not we’re stuck with passwords for the  predictable future. Luckily there is a solution: it’s called a password manager. With a password manager you’ll only need to remember one password (the master password), all the other ones will be entered automatically for you in the login forms. I use <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>, but there are other products on the market: <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>, <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>, <a href="http://www.roboform.com/">RoboForm</a>… Most of those products are not free but I’m sure you’ll prefer to drop a few dozens dollars every few years instead of seeing your online (and sometimes offline) life ruined.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve addressed password best practices on the users’ side it’s time to mention the other side. The services that you use should do everything they can in order to protect your password. There is a <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/06/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-7.html">lot</a> to say in this area but I decided to address the features that are easily observable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>passwords requirements: services shouldn’t restrict the length of our passwords (at least not smaller than a few dozens characters) or the characters’ set that we can use (this would reduce the entropy)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/your-login-form-posts-to-https-but-you.html">proper use of HTTPS</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/05/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know.html">reset password feature</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a> vulnerability I decided to change some of my passwords recently. To my surprise many well known services impose some strong restrictions on the passwords users can set. Shall we get started? The offenders are ordered from worst ones to the most benign ones.</p>

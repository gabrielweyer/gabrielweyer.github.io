I"<p>Every now and then I stumble upon a brilliant post on Internet, I share some of those links on my <a href="https://www.diigo.com/user/gabrielweyer">Diigo profile</a> but the format is very succinct. I decided to start a new experiment and instead write full blog posts about those links. The first reason is quite selfish as I would like to keep a record of what I thought was interesting and why, I also hope to empower the reader so that she can decide if she wants to read the full post as some of them are lengthy.</p>

<p>I’m considering limiting each of those post to up to three links as to not require too much time from the reader.</p>

<p>This is inspired by the excellent work that Chris Alcock and Michael Wolfenden are doing with respectively <a href="http://blog.cwa.me.uk/">The Morning Brew</a> and <a href="https://michael-wolfenden.github.io/">The Wolf Report</a>. Don’t be surprised if I end up <del>stealing</del> borrowing some links from them.</p>

<p>Without further ado let me get started with the first links.</p>

I"Ğ<p>I like football, even with the time difference I try to watch at least the World Cup and the European Championship. I watched the last World Cup on <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/">SBS</a> but this time around they only managed to secure a handful of games. As theyâ€™re a public service it makes sense after all that they wouldnâ€™t buy the rights for all the games. A quick search on Google indicated that <a href="http://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/home">beIN SPORTS CONNECT</a>Â is the way to go in Australia - I will refer to this service as beIN for the rest of this post.</p>

<p>As the pricing seems reasonable I decided to go ahead. The page is loaded over HTTPS so we start well but to my surprise the form contains a <strong>password remainder</strong> field. Password remainders areÂ a bad practice as users tend to fill them with their password (when allowed) or with a hint that is an obvious give away.<!--more--></p>

<p>As I donâ€™t know any of my password, a password reminder is useless to me so I always generate a strong unique random password for this field. After trying to submit the form I got the following error:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2016-06-13-bein-sports-connect/password-remainder.png" alt="password-remainder" /></p>

<p>I donâ€™t understand the benefits of restricting the characters I can use. On the contrary it seems to indicate this site is potentially vulnerable to <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/understanding-xss-input-sanitisation/">XSS</a>. I generate another reminderÂ without â€œspecialâ€ characters and get presented with another error:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2016-06-13-bein-sports-connect/invalid-format.png" alt="invalid-format" /></p>

<p>So my valid email address is in an â€œIncorrect formatâ€. HowÂ convenient should theyÂ ever decide to sell my data to a third party without me being able to track it back to them.</p>

<p>I start to have a bad feeling about the password requirements. After all the only one that is stated is that my password should be at least 6 characters. I decide to use â€œ123456â€ and also use it as the password reminder. <strong>&lt;clickbait&gt;</strong>You wonâ€™t believe what happens next!<strong>&lt;/clickbait&gt;</strong>. Actually Iâ€™m sure you knew what would happen: the form happily accepted my password and let me reuse it in the reminder field. Well at least I â€œ<em>can access the site</em> <strong>securely</strong>â€ (emphasis is mine).</p>

<p>One last thing before we move on to the dessert. Does it seem normal to be loading so many third party JavaScript filesÂ on a registration page? Theyâ€™re even loading ads and we know what malicious ads do to your browser and itâ€™s not kind (malware installation, credentials theftâ€¦).</p>

<h1 id="sign-inform-loaded-over-http">Sign-inÂ form loaded over HTTP</h1>

<p>Yes you read that right. Even though the form is POSTing to HTTPS by then it is <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/your-login-form-posts-to-https-but-you/">too late</a>. An attacker could have already intercepted the initial HTTP response and pointed the form to the URL of his choosing.</p>

<p>Sometimes websites still offer sign-in over HTTPS when you look for it but it doesnâ€™t seem to be the case here.Â  <a href="https://secure.beinsportsconnect.com.au/">https://secure.beinsportsconnect.com.au/</a> redirects toÂ <a href="http://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/">http://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/</a>Â and trying to access <a href="https://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/">https://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/</a>Â results in something you should never see:</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>If youâ€™re already using beIN or are planning on starting to use itÂ at least generateÂ a unique password so that when they get compromised attackers will not gain access to your account on other services.</p>

<p>I understand going all HTTPS would require a tremendous amount of work but beIN could first take some other steps that would make a big difference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the password reminder altogether</li>
  <li>Provide a dedicated HTTPS only sign-in page</li>
  <li>Stop loading third-partyÂ ads on the sign-in page</li>
</ul>

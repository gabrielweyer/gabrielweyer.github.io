I"g<p>Recently I came up with an interesting issue at a customer. A governmental agency contacted us and informed us that due to a Windows update we could experience intermittent issue when trying to communicate with them. All I knew at this stage was that the issue would manifest itself when trying to upload a document and that the integration is done via DLLs that are wrapping a few web services.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/decompiler/2016.1/Generating_PDB_Files.html">generating PDBs</a> via <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/">dotPeek</a> and adding them to the Visual Studio symbol cache directory I was able to debug through those third party DLLs and confirm that the issue was indeed located in one of them.</p>

<p>Knowing the DLL is redistributed with the product, is in multiple production versions and that the source control’s history is pretty patchy, the question then become: <strong>if we were to get a new DLL could we use it for all the versions?</strong></p>

<p>To answer this question we will have to assess the differences between the DLL in each version.</p>

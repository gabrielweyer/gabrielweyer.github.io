I"ê<p>Today‚Äôs exercise is not an exercise! The investigation I‚Äôm about to describe was triggered by a production outage affecting multiple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">API</code>s - albeit not at the same time - at a customer. For obvious reasons I‚Äôll not be able to share the code and will have to alter / obfuscate some of the commands‚Äô results. I still think this is a valuable exercise as it is a classic example of an easy to make mistake leading to a catastrophic result.</p>

<p>The other interesting point is that I had no idea what the issue was so I‚Äôll not be following a script as I did in the first instalment.</p>

<p>I like building, supporting and operating products. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C#</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ASP.NET Core</code> are the tools Iâ€™m the most proficient with.

<p>Iâ€™m grateful for all the amazing frameworks and libraries available. I share the <a href="https://github.com/gabrielweyer/nuggets">tips and trick</a> Iâ€™ve accumulated over the years on <a href="https://github.com/gabrielweyer">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/gabrielweyer/cake-build">demonstrated</a> how to use <a href="https://cakebuild.net/">Cake</a> to build a NuGet package using AppVeyor, Azure DevOps, CircleCI and GitHub Actions. <a href="https://github.com/gabrielweyer/azure-vm-pricing">Azure VM pricing</a> was the opportunity to experiment with Puppeteer, I used it when costing a lift-and-shift migration dealing with many thousands VMs of varied sizes. My most recent project is an attempt to improve <a href="https://github.com/gabrielweyer/azure-functions-telemetry">Azure Functions integration with Application Insights</a>.</p>

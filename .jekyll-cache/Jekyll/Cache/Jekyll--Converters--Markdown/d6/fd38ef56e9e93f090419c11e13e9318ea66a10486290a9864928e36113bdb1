I"è<p>Being the happy owner of a Kindle I usually buy my ebooks on Amazon. They have a very large selection to choose from and normally sell all the latest releases. To my surprise they only had ‚Äú<a href="(http://us.macmillan.com/enigmaofchina/qiuxiaolong)">Enigma of China</a>‚Äù from Qiu Xialong in paperback and hardcover formats. <a href="http://store.kobobooks.com/en-US/Search/Query?query=Enigma%20of%20China&amp;dontModifyQuery=True">Kobo</a> didn‚Äôt have it at all but after searching for a while I found out that Barnes &amp; Noble sold it as a¬†<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/enigma-of-china-qiu-xiaolong/1114701902?ean=9781250025814">NOOK Book</a> for $10.</p>

<p>So far, so good or so it seemed. It turned out that Barnes &amp; Noble has such a lax approach of security that at the end I decided not to purchase from them. You‚Äôll find below the reasons that motivated my decision.</p>

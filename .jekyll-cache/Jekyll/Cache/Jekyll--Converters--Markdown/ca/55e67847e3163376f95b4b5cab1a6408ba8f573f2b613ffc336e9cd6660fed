I"<p><strong>25th of Sep 2021</strong>: I decided to remove Travis CI from this post. Travis CI recently <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/15/travis_ci_leak/">poorly handled a security vulnerability</a> and security is of paramount importance when it comes to build systems.</p>

<p><strong>5th of Jan 2019</strong>: a lot has been happening since I initially wrote this post. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Azure DevOps</code> released a free tier for open source projects, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cake</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GitVersion</code> contributors have been hard at work to take advantage of the latest features of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.NET Core</code>. So many things have changed that I decided to update this post to reflect the current state of affairs (inclusion of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Azure DevOps</code>, upgrade to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.NET Core 2.2</code>, utilisation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.NET Core global tools</code> and removing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mono</code> requirement on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unix</code> platforms).</p>

<p>As a developer Iâ€™m amazed by the number of free tools and services available. I wanted to create an end-to-end demo of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CI/CD</code> pipeline that would include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/2018/04/21/cake-build/#configuration">Trigger a build on commit</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2018/04/21/cake-build/#semantic-versioning">Use semantic versioning</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2018/04/21/cake-build/#run-the-tests">Run tests</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2018/04/21/cake-build/#publish-the-test-results">Publish test results</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2018/04/21/cake-build/#create-nuget-packages">Create NuGet packages</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2018/04/21/cake-build/#publish-the-nuget-packages">Publish the NuGet packages</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2018/04/21/cake-build/#create-a-github-release">Create a GitHub release</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For my purpose I wanted anonymous users to have access to a read-only view. I initially selected <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> as it seems to be the most popular choice for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.NET</code> open-source projects. But while browsing around I discovered that projects were often using more than one platform. <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a> seemed to be the other prevailing option. Since the initial version of this post, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a> has released a <del>free and unlimited plan for open source projects</del> (<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/change-in-azure-pipelines-grant-for-public-projects/">this is not the case any more</a>). I decided to leverage the three platforms so that I could highlight their pros and cons.</p>

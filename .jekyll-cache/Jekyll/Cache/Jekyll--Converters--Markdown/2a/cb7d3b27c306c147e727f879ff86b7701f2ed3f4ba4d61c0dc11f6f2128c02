I"˜<p>Another day, another â€œinterestingâ€ issue at a customer. After deploying our product we were left with a partially working web application. The productÂ has been developed over many years and is a mix of ASP Classic, Web Forms, MVC and Web API.Â In this case ASP Classic pages were broken and would throw an error.</p>

<h2 id="ensuring-asp-classic-is-configured-properly">Ensuring ASP Classic is configured properly</h2>

<p>The first step is to ensure that IIS has been configured to execute ASP Classic andÂ this is done easily by adding a dummyÂ ASP page to the web application. After deploying this page I was able to confirm that itÂ was working as expected.</p>

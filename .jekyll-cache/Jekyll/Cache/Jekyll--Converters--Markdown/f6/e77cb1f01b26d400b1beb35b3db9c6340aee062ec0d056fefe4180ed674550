I"g<p>After eyeing it for a while I finally decided to buy <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7306509-advanced-net-debugging">Advanced .NET Debugging</a> by Mario Hewardt. I’ve been studying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WinDbg</code> for some time and consider myself somewhere between beginner and intermediate level. To my dismay I got stuck on the first excercise! Luckily I didn’t give up and finally stumbled on a blog post that unblocked me. This series has for goal to make <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7306509-advanced-net-debugging">Advanced .NET Debugging</a> more accessible to people - quite like me - that haven’t grasped all the concepts yet.</p>

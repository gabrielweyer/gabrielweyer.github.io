### Open-source

I [contribute][github-profile] to open-source as a way to show my gratitude for all the amazing frameworks and libraries available. My latest contributions include [Cake][cake] and [WebApi.Hal][webapi-hal].

I wrote [Beanstalk Seeder][beanstalk-seeder] and [Simple Routing][simple-routing] to ease `AWS Beanstalk` development. I created [Unsupported Types][unsupported-types] to be able to store objects transparently in Azure Table storage. My most popular `NuGet` package is [xunit-to-junit][xunit-to-junit], a `.NET Core` global tool that transforms `xUnit.net v2 XML` test results file into a `JUnit` test results file.

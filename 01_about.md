{{ site.description }}

I like building, supporting and operating products. `C#` and `ASP.NET Core` are the tools I'm the most proficient with. I've a keen interest in Continuous Integration and Deployment, testing, logging, cloud, distributed systems, security and troubleshooting.

## Open-source

I'm grateful for all the amazing frameworks and libraries available. I share the [tips and trick][nuggets] I've accumulated over the years on [GitHub][github-profile].

I [demonstrated][cake-build] how to use [Cake][cake] to build a NuGet package using AppVeyor, Azure DevOps, CircleCI and GitHub Actions. [Azure VM pricing][azure-vm-pricing] was the opportunity to experiment with Puppeteer, I used it when costing a lift-and-shift migration dealing with many thousands VMs of varied sizes. My most recent project is an attempt to improve [Azure Functions integration with Application Insights][azure-functions-telemetry].

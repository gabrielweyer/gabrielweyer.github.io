            <p>Every now and then I stumble upon a brilliant post on Internet, I share some of those links on my <a href="https://www.diigo.com/user/gabrielweyer">Diigo profile</a> but the format is very succinct. I decided to start a new experiment and instead write full blog posts about those links. The first reason is quite selfish as I would like to keep a record of what I thought was interesting and why, I also hope to empower the reader so that she can decide if she wants to read the full post as some of them are lengthy.</p>

<p>I’m considering limiting each of those post to up to three links as to not require too much time from the reader.</p>

<p>This is inspired by the excellent work that Chris Alcock and Michael Wolfenden are doing with respectively <a href="http://blog.cwa.me.uk/">The Morning Brew</a> and <a href="https://michael-wolfenden.github.io/">The Wolf Report</a>. Don’t be surprised if I end up <del>stealing</del> borrowing some links from them.</p>

<p>Without further ado let me get started with the first links.</p>

            <p>Another day, another “interesting” issue at a customer. After deploying our product we were left with a partially working web application. The product has been developed over many years and is a mix of ASP Classic, Web Forms, MVC and Web API. In this case ASP Classic pages were broken and would throw an error.</p>

<h2 id="ensuring-asp-classic-is-configured-properly">Ensuring ASP Classic is configured properly</h2>

<p>The first step is to ensure that IIS has been configured to execute ASP Classic and this is done easily by adding a dummy ASP page to the web application. After deploying this page I was able to confirm that it was working as expected.</p>

            <p>I like football, even with the time difference I try to watch at least the World Cup and the European Championship. I watched the last World Cup on <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/">SBS</a> but this time around they only managed to secure a handful of games. As they’re a public service it makes sense after all that they wouldn’t buy the rights for all the games. A quick search on Google indicated that <a href="http://www.beinsportsconnect.com.au/home">beIN SPORTS CONNECT</a> is the way to go in Australia - I will refer to this service as beIN for the rest of this post.</p>

<h1 id="subscribing">Subscribing</h1>

<p>As the pricing seems reasonable I decided to go ahead. The page is loaded over HTTPS so we start well but to my surprise the form contains a <strong>password remainder</strong> field. Password remainders are a bad practice as users tend to fill them with their password (when allowed) or with a hint that is an obvious give away.</p>

            <p>Recently I came up with an interesting issue at a customer. A governmental agency contacted us and informed us that due to a Windows update we could experience intermittent issue when trying to communicate with them. All I knew at this stage was that the issue would manifest itself when trying to upload a document and that the integration is done via DLLs that are wrapping a few web services.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/decompiler/2016.1/Generating_PDB_Files.html">generating PDBs</a> via <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/">dotPeek</a> and adding them to the Visual Studio symbol cache directory I was able to debug through those third party DLLs and confirm that the issue was indeed located in one of them.</p>

<p>Knowing the DLL is redistributed with the product, is in multiple production versions and that the source control’s history is pretty patchy, the question then become: <strong>if we were to get a new DLL could we use it for all the versions?</strong></p>

<p>To answer this question we will have to assess the differences between the DLL in each version.</p>
